A 3d library/framework for Android using Java and OpenGL ES

min3D is a lightweight 3d library/framework for Android using Java with OpenGL ES targeting compatibility with Android v1.5/OpenGL ES 1.0 and higher.


It tracks closely with the OpenGL ES API, which makes it ideal for gaining an understanding of the OpenGL ES API while providing the convenience of an object-oriented class library.
